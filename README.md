# Hello,

This is the GitHub account from Steven K, I created this account to use it to work on projects from the [Hoppinger Group](https://hoppinger.com/). 

This account does not contain any personal projects or repo's, all repositories are forks of tools I used during my job at Hoppinger and [Vidda Digital](https://viddadigital.com). 

Company mail adress: [steven@hoppinger.com](mailto:steven@hoppinger.com)

## Tech stack
I mainly used: 
- Dotnet
- React
- Typescript

### A fact about me
My favorite editor is VS Code! (Who else loves it?)

> Testing does not verify the absence of bugs, only the presence.

## Want to know more? 
Check out my personal GitHub profile [@Steven24K](https://github.com/Steven24K), for all my personal projects.
